# Checkout

The Checkout page is a required page that contains the _Checkout_ widget. This widget is populated once a buyer clicks _Checkout_ to submit an order. Custom checkout steps can also be implemented using extension points. To learn more see [Implementing a Custom Checkout Step](../../../../developer-guide/tutorial/implementing-a-custom-checkout-step/README.md).

During the checkout process, there are several pages to enter the buyer's shipping and billing addresses and choose a shipment method. The last two pages are the _Order Summary_ and _Order Confirmation_.

## Entering a Shipping Address

Note that if the buyer checks the _Use shipping address as billing address_, this will skip the Billing Address page.

## Selecting Shipping Method

Shipping methods available to a buyer are configured by changing _Shipping Methods_ in _Site Administration_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_ -> _Shipping Methods_. See [Using the Flat Rate Shipping Method](../../../sales/shipping/using-the-flat-rate-shipping-method/README.md) for more information.

## Entering a Billing Address

As noted above, this page appears only if the buyer's billing address is different from the shipping address.

When an order is confirmed, the order is ready for processing by the seller. See [Order Life Cycle](../../../sales/order-management/order-life-cycle/README.md) for more information.
