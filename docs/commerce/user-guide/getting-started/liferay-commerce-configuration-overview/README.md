# Liferay Commerce Configuration Overview

Liferay Commerce configurations are divided into several locations in the Liferay _Product Menu_. The Commerce _Control Panel_ drop down contains configurations and settings that apply _globally_ to the Liferay Commerce installation. The Commerce _Site Menu_ drop down contains configurations and settings that are scoped to a specific store site.
