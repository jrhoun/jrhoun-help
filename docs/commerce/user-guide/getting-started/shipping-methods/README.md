# Shipping Methods

Liferay Commerce supports several shipping methods and carriers. Before choosing any shipping method, verify the [Measurement Units](../../sales/shipping/measurement-units/README.md) that the store will use.

Here are several shipping methods:

* [Variable Rate](../../sales/shipping/using-the-variable-rate-shipping-method/README.md)
* [Flat Rate](../../sales/shipping/using-the-flat-rate-shipping-method/README.md)
* [FedEx](../../sales/shipping/using-fedex-as-a-carrier-method/README.md)

  > Note that FedEx is available only for Commerce Enterprise subscribers. For users interested in adding other carriers, see [Implementing a New Shipping Engine](../../../developer-guide/tutorial/implementing-a-new-shipping-engine/README.md).

Shipping methods may be restricted by country or region. To learn more, see [Applying Shipping Method Restrictions](../../sales/shipping/applying-shipping-method-restrictions/README.md).
